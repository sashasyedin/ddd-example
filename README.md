# Domain.Seedwork

This is a library designed to provide common base classes and interfaces for Domain-Driven Design (DDD) projects. It aims to encapsulate generic domain logic and patterns that can be reused across different domains and applications. This is the type of copy and paste reuse that developers can share between projects, not a formal framework.

## Purpose

The purpose of the library is to centralize and standardize essential DDD definitions such as entities, value objects, repositories, domain events, and specifications. By defining these core concepts in a reusable manner, developers can focus more on domain-specific logic and less on boilerplate code.

## Key Components

### Entity
An Entity is an object within the domain that is uniquely identifiable through its identity. Entities have a lifecycle and are distinguished from other objects by their identity.

### Aggregate Root
An aggregate root is the main entity within an aggregate, a cluster of related objects that ensures the integrity and consistency of changes by enforcing rules and invariants. The aggregate root is the sole entity through which external objects communicate.

### Value Object
A Value Object is an immutable object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain without an identity. Equality is based on the equality of its attributes.

### Repository
A Repository is a mechanism that provides a collection-like interface for storing and retrieving domain objects. It encapsulates the logic for persistence and allows the application to work with domain objects without knowing the details of the underlying data store.

### Domain Event
A Domain Event represents an event that has occurred within the domain. It is used to communicate changes or significant occurrences within the domain model and facilitates decoupled communication between domain entities and services.

### Specification
A Specification is a reusable query component that defines criteria for selecting domain objects. It encapsulates business rules and conditions in a composable manner, allowing for flexible querying and filtering of domain objects.
